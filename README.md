# Veggie-Shop

A web app I built for the final-term project of the course "PhÃ¡t triá»ƒn Web Front-end". The main aim of this project was to build a site for admins to manage products using Auth and Firestore services of Firebase. In addition to required ones, I added some more features such as role system and staff management.
